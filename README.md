### Quick Start

In your pair, decide who will own the fork. That person then forks this repository and adds their pair partner as a contributor. Both then clone the forked repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone [the fork] && cd pairing_exercises
$ bundle install
```


### Instructions

1. Start with the Scrabble exercise.

2. Set a 10 min timer to prompt you to switch pairing roles.
- when the timer goes off, the driver pushes their work to the project repository on Github.
- the next driver makes sure their local clone is up to date by pulling down the changes.

3. We'll have a short reflection halfway through.
   - What's going well?
   - what can you improve on?

4. We'll reflect on the exercise at the end
